# MeshLifter

MeshLifter: Weakly supervised approach for 3D human mesh reconstruction from a single 2D pose based on loop structure

To download data files like  annotation for Human3.6M

demo.py :  To visualize 2D pose(input), reconstructed 3D Mesh and corresponding 2D images(Not input) 

test.py :  To quantitatively evaluated this project

And you have to change the path of annoatation file, pretrained model and smpl files..
